# Libft

Libft is the first project at School 42, designed to introduce students to the basics of C programming and library creation. The goal is to implement a custom library of functions that mimic standard C library functions, with additional features for future projects.

## Project Details
- **Score**: 125/100
- **Language**: C

This repository contains all mandatory and bonus functions as specified in the project requirements.

## Features
### Mandatory Part
- Reimplementation of standard C library functions, such as:
  - String manipulation: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strdup`
  - Memory handling: `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`
  - Character checks: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_tolower`
- Other utility functions for common tasks.

### Bonus Part
- Linked list management functions: `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstdelone`, etc.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd libft42
   ```

## Compilation
To compile the library, use the included `Makefile`:
```bash
make
```

This will generate the `libft.a` static library file.

## Usage
Include the library in your C projects:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```


## Advice for Success
- **Understand the Basics**: Master the functionality of each function before implementing it.
- **Testing**: Write test cases for each function to validate correctness and handle edge cases.
- **Memory Management**: Be cautious about memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Modularity**: Keep your code organized and modular for easier debugging and readability.
- **Learn the Makefile**: Understanding how a `Makefile` works will help you manage your projects more efficiently.

## Good Luck!
Libft is the foundation of many future projects at 42. Take your time to understand each function deeply, and donâ€™t hesitate to ask for help or refer to online resources. Best of luck on your journey!
